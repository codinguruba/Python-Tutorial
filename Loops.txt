Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow programmers to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
Loops or Iteration Statements in Programming are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition.

for loops in python.
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
(that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

# Example program
for i in range(1, 6):
  print(i)


# Example program

for i in range(0,5):
    print("Hello world")


# Example code of list iteration using foor loop 

cars = ["volvo","mercedes","tesla","BMW"]
for x in cars:
     print(x)


i = 1
while(i<6):
    print("Coding class")
    i+= 1
