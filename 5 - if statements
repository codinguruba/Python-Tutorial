if statement
In computer programming, the if statement is a conditional statement. It is used to execute a block of code only when a specific condition is met.

In Python, if statements are used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

Syntax
if condition: 
# code to execute if the condition is true



if else
An if statement can have an optional else clause. The else statement executes if the condition in the if statement evaluates to False.

if (3>2):
print(“This gets executed if condition is true”)

else:
   print(“I am executed if the above condition is false”)


elif in Python
‘elif’ stands for ‘else if’ and is used in Python programming to test multiple conditions. It is written following an if statement in
Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.




if condition1:
    statement to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
statement to execute if condition2 is true
else :
     statement to execute if both conditions are false
