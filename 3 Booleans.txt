Boolean is just another data type similar to integers and strings.
However, Boolean variables can have only two values: True and False.
Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

print(11 > 9)         True
print(10 == 9)        False
print(11 < 9)         False
print(10 == 10)       True


Where do we use booleans?
- We use booleans in conditional statements.

Example

age = 22
if(age>18):
  print(" You can vote")
