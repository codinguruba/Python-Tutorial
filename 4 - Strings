Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'Ojashwi' is the same as "Ojashwi".

In Python, strings are used for representing textual data. 
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (“”).

Assign String to a Variable

a = "Helloworld"
print(a)

Some library functions in Strings.

The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

a = "Ojashwi"
print(a.upper())

The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

a = "OJASHWI"
print(a.lower())
